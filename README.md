# Food-finder
In order to teach myself how to build a RESTful API, I created this project. The project uses MongoDB, Express, Nodejs, and Reactjs (MERN). Another focus of this project was to work more on CSS styling and improve layout and overall aesthetics of my applications.

  The layout of the RESTful API was broken down into routes for good practice. In this particular API, there was only one endpoint so this is fairly straight forward (the request handling can be found in 'backend/Api/Routes/providers.js'). The API supports 'GET', 'POST', 'PATCH', and 'DELETE' request types, however the front end only demonstrates requests of type 'GET'. 
  
 REQUESTS:
      'GET':
      
      
      
      'POST':
